Reliable camera input is essential for safety-critical ADAS perception, but most monitoring approaches detect sensor failures only after downstream performance has degraded. We propose a proactive camera reliability monitoring framework that estimates perception risk from degradation-induced uncertainty patterns before downstream failure becomes observable. The method introduces a Global Sensor Health Index (GSHI), a continuous reliability score that aggregates per-degradation severities using a risk-aware multiplicative formulation, allowing severe single-mode failures such as lens occlusion or motion blur to dominate the health estimate. A lightweight multi-task network predicts degradation type, severity, GSHI, and spatial uncertainty maps from a single RGB image without downstream task feedback. Training uses physics- and geometry-aware synthetic supervision over twelve camera degradation modes. Experiments on KITTI-derived degradations show that GSHI decreases monotonically with severity, achieves a health-estimation MAE of 0.064, and provides positive early-warning lead time of 0.47 $\pm$ 0.25 severity units before YOLOv8 detection failure. GSHI also outperforms IQA, detector-confidence, and clean-feature OOD baselines, and transfers zero-shot to real adverse-weather driving data. These results support degradation-aware uncertainty analysis as a practical direction for proactive camera reliability monitoring in intelligent vehicles.
